 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11197249/show-system-files-show-git-ignore-in-osx I really needed this to show me how to view hidden files (i.e. '.gitignore') on my Mac, really surprised me that this wasn't covered in the class. roosto's answer on Jul 10 '17 at 18:29; showed me how to use (Command Shift .) to toggle AppleShowAllFiles. Otherwise I didn't know how else to add file names to my .gitignore file.
